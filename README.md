1. Problem Statement An aspiring chef Sam is learning to prepare a dish that needs just two ingredients salt(S) and pepper(P). As per the instructions given to him, in order to make a balanced dish, he must use equal quantities of salt and pepper. In the pantry the salt and pepper packets are placed in a random sequence. Samâ€™s job is to try and make as many balanced dishes as he can. But there is a rule in the kitchen that he can only use chunks of ingredients that are placed together. Can you help Sam figure out the maximum number of balanced dishes he can make using all the salt and pepper packets in the pantry? You can assume that the pantry always has an equal quantity of salt and pepper packets. Which means that Sam can make at least one balanced dish using all the salt and pepper in the pantry.
